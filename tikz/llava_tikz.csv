1,"The image is a detailed diagram of a random number generator. The diagram is divided into three sections, each with a different purpose. The first section is a text-based description of the random number generator, providing a clear understanding of its structure and function. The second section is a visual representation of the generator, with arrows and labels indicating the various components and their relationships. The third section is a text-based description of the visual representation, further clarifying the details of the diagram.

The diagram is color-coded, with blue representing the text-based descriptions, green representing the visual representation, and white representing the text-based description of the visual representation.

The third section is red, representing the data flow between the servers.

There are several servers and connections visible in the diagram. The servers are distributed across the green section, with some located closer to the left side, while others are positioned more towards the right side. The connections between the servers are represented by the yellow lines, which are intertwined and overlapping to create a complex network.

The red section of the diagram highlights the data flow between the servers, indicating the direction and movement of information. Overall, the image provides a clear visual representation of a networked system, with the servers, connections, and data flow all clearly defined and organized.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

197,"The image features a black and white diagram with a focus on a triangle. The triangle is composed of three smaller triangles, each with a different size and position. The triangles are arranged in a way that creates a sense of depth and complexity.

There are several arrows pointing in various directions, indicating the flow of energy or information within the diagram. The arrows are placed at different angles and heights, adding to the visual interest of the image.

In addition to the arrows, there are labels and numbers scattered throughout the diagram, providing context and information about the elements within the image. The labels and numbers are placed in a way that complements the overall structure of the triangle and its smaller components.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

1. The first graph on the left is labeled \( K_{1,n} \). It resembles a star, where one central vertex is connected to \( n \) outer vertices by edges radiating outward.

2. Next is \( K_n \), which is a simple complete graph. It consists of \( n \) vertices, with each vertex connected to every other vertex, resulting in a fully interconnected shape.

3. The third graph is labeled \( CK_n \), which does not clearly resemble any standard shape but depicts a bipartite graph involving two sets of vertices. Each vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set, with no internal edges.

4. The fourth diagram is labeled \( T_n \). This graph features a combination of edges that connect vertices in a manner similar to a tree structure, but with multiple connections between some vertices, creating a more complex branching effect.

5. Lastly, the fifth graph is labeled \( K^*_n \) and appears as a circular arrangement of vertices. Each vertex is connected in such a way that they form a closed loop, resembling a cycle graph.

All diagrams use simple black lines for edges and dots for vertices, arranged neatly in a horizontal layout for clarity.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

The graph has horizontal and vertical axes. The horizontal axis, labeled ""strain,"" is measured in increments of 0 to 8, marked as .10^-3, indicating small strain values. The vertical axis is labeled ""stress [MPa],"" ranging from approximately -200 MPa to 200 MPa.

The graph features multiple overlapping curves, shown in black. Each curve has a distinct shape that starts from the origin and rises to a peak before descending, indicating the material's elastic and plastic behavior under stress. The curves appear to have a zig-zag pattern, reflecting the loading and unloading process, with points where the curves flatten out at the peaks, denoting stages of yield and recovery. The curves are clustered, and some are closer together than others, indicating varying degrees of strain for different stress levels. The overall appearance is that of a series of symmetric, replicating shapes, which suggests the material exhibits consistent behavior across cycles.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

The structure appears to represent connections or relationships between the labeled nodes.

Overall, the left side depicts a coordinate system with labeled points, while the right side illustrates a network of nodes connected by edges, with color coding to differentiate relationships.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

The second row features a series of nodes labeled \(x_{L,t-1}\), \(x_{L,t}\), and \(x_{L,t+1}\), also aligned left to right. Each node in both the first and second rows has a downward arrow leading to the row below it.

The lowest row contains three circular nodes labeled \(y_{t-1}\), \(y_t\), and \(y_{t+1}\) from left to right. These nodes are shaded, distinguishing them from the nodes above. The arrows point downwards from every \(x\) node to the corresponding \(y\) nodes. Additionally, there are dotted lines linking the \(x\) nodes on the same level, indicating a connection between them, although the exact relationship is not specified. The overall structure resembles a time series or sequence model, facilitating the understanding of dependencies across different time steps.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

In all three figures, the triangles are constructed from three vertices, and there are vertical dashed lines extending from the base vertices upward and downward. 

In the first triangle, the left vertex points slightly downwards, the top vertex points upwards, and the right vertex points slightly downwards, creating an inverted triangle shape. There are arrows indicating direction along the vertical dashed lines connected to the left and right vertices that point both up and down.

The second triangle is similar but appears slightly taller, with the top vertex extending further upwards. The arrows along the vertical lines also point both up and down, indicating movement or force.

The third triangle is the same as the first two in terms of shape, but the lines appear bolder, and the arrows indicate movement more strongly along the vertical lines near the vertices. There are no arrows on the horizontal base line itself. The center dashed vertical line remains prominent, extending from the base towards the top but does not connect to any of the vertices.

An arrow labeled ""Swapping last layer"" arcs from the Pre-training Task Layer to the right side of the image, where there is a section titled ""Classification Layer."" This section also connects to another ""BERT Encoder"" positioned below it, mirroring the left side. Similar to the left side, it has three output nodes labeled O1, O2, O3 above it and connected to the same input nodes labeled W1, W2, and W3 underneath.

The box plots for the models from left to right are ""Reg-Unet,"" ""Reg,"" ""Reg-VGG,"" ""Residual,"" and ""IncDice."" 

The y-axis ranges from 0% to about 3%, with marked increments. Each box plot shows the median (the line inside the box), which varies across the models, indicating different central tendency values for the NMAE. The boxes have different heights and positions: ""Reg-Unet"" has the highest median, around 2.5%, while ""Residual"" and ""IncDice"" are lower, around 1.5%. 

Whiskers extend from the boxes to represent variability outside the upper and lower quartiles, with dots indicating individual outlier data points. The boxes are colored differently, with ""Reg-Unet"" in blue, ""Reg"" in orange, ""Reg-VGG"" in green, ""Residual"" in purple, and ""IncDice"" in a darker purple, all placed against a white background.

img_0170.png,"The image consists of two rows of symbols, each containing a mix of horizontal, diagonal, and straight lines connecting circles. 

In the top row, there are three labeled segments: on the left, the symbol ""σ₁"" is positioned above a horizontal line connecting two circles. Next to it, on the right side, is the symbol ""σ₃⁻¹,"" placed above a diagonal line that connects two circles; this line crosses a horizontal line that runs between them, indicating intersections. There are two straight horizontal lines connecting circles positioned below the diagonal line.

The bottom row mirrors the top, but the configuration is slightly altered. It has the same two circles at the ends connected by straight horizontal lines, while the middle features two lines crossing diagonally between the circles. The intersections of these diagonal lines create additional links, and there are two connections using diagonal lines resembling small arrows, resembling the way the lines connect with the circles in the first row.

Overall, the design features a systematic arrangement of circles connected by various lines, with specific labels for some segments.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

img_0193.png,"The image depicts a graph showing two distinct states of physical systems represented with pressure (P) as the vertical axis and a variable (not labeled, but likely related to volume or another thermodynamic property) as the horizontal axis. On the left side, the curves are labeled W2 and R2, represented by a blue curve and a black curve respectively. The blue curve (W2) appears to rise and then fall, while the black curve (R2) also fluctuates but remains lower than W2. 

On the right side, there are again two curves labeled W1 and R1. The curve W1 is shown in red and resembles W2 in shape but is higher overall on the graph. The black curve R1 is similar in style to R2, floating below W1. The vertical line between the two sides denotes a dividing point, and it seems to indicate some transition between the two systems in the graph. The overall layout features smooth, continuous curves with the lines intersecting at certain points, contributing to a clear visual contrast between the two sets of curves.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

Vertices v1 and v2 are positioned at the lower left, both connected to vertex v3, which is in the center of the lower row. Vertex v3 connects horizontally to vertex v4, located slightly above it. Above v4, there are two vertices: v5, which is directly above v4, and v6, which is positioned to the upper right. Vertex v5 is horizontally aligned with v4 and connected to vertex v6. In the upper left, vertex v7 is positioned vertically higher and connects to v5. 

Connections between vertices are represented by lines: v1 and v2 connect to v3, v3 connects to v4, v4 connects to v5, v5 connects to v6, and v6 connects back to v7, creating a somewhat symmetrical structure with a horizontal arrangement of vertices along the center.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

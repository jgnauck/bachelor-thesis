Additionally, a square filled symbol represents points in the data set, primarily placed horizontally across the graph’s middle portion.

On the bottom part, a vector labeled ξ'ₛ points similarly but in the opposite direction. 

The sphere is oriented such that the y-axis extends horizontally to the right, the z-axis extends vertically upwards, and the x-axis extends horizontally to the left.

Two dashed lines extend from this point outward, illustrating the paths of projectiles or particles approaching and leaving the curve.

Above this, there is a vertical line labeled “y0,” pointing upwards from the minimum point to indicate the height.

At the bottom left, there is a vector labeled “v∞,” pointing diagonally towards the left, signifying an incoming velocity. At the bottom right, there is another vector labeled “v+,” also pointing diagonally but in the opposite direction, suggesting an outgoing velocity.

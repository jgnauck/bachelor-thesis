Two points along this arc are marked by small circles, each corresponding to locations where tangent vectors are illustrated. At each point, a red and blue vector lie tangent to the circle, extending in opposite directions along the curve. From a common origin above these two points, two black arrows extend outward. These arrows are labeled $\vec{e}_1(x)$ and $\vec{e}_2(x)$ and they represent vector directions associated with the point x.

The y-axis is labeled ""Probability"" and ranges from 0.25 to 1.00. The plot shows a red curve and a green curve that form an X shape and cross at the point (0.50, 0.50). The bottom-left plot also has t on the x-axis and is labeled y on the vertical axes, which ranges from 0 to 3. The red curve is in U-shape with the vertex at (0.50,0), alongside a green horizontal line at y=1. Both lines have black dots placed on them. The center plot is a duplicate of the bottom-left plot spanning over two columns. In the top-right plot, the x-axis is labeled t and the y-axis is labeled ""Cover Rate"" and ranges from 0.900 to 1.000. A blue curve fluctuates slightly around y = 0.950, showing modest variations. In the bottom-right plot the x-axis is labeled t and the y-axis is labeled ""Average Length"" and ranges from 0.6 to 1.2. A blue curve runs across the plot, containing segments that are dotted. These dotted segments from a U-shape. A legend below the grid indicates that red corresponds to ""Group 1"" and green to ""Group 2"" and that solid lines represent ""Estimated"" values, while dotted lines represent ""True"" values.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

Specifically, the letter $\gamma$ is written inside multiple cells, including cells 2, 12, 10, 4 and 6. The letter $\beta$ appears in cell 3.

198,"Six partition aligned horizontally and connected by right-pointing arrows. Each partition is labeled with a rank decreasing from 5 to 0. At rank 5, the partition is written as: $1111\mid12$. An arrow points to rank 4, which shows the configuration: $\begin{array}{c} 111 \\ 1 \end{array} \mid \begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 1\end{array}$. Next, at rank 3, the partition is: $\begin{array}{c} 12 \\ 2 \end{array} \mid \begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 1 \end{array}$. At rank 2, the partition changes to: $\begin{array}{c} 12 \\ \\ 1 \end{array} \mid \begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 1 \\ \end{array}$. At rank 1, the configuration becomes: $\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 2 \\ \\ 1 \end{array} \mid \begin{array}{c} 2 \\ \\ 1 \\ \end{array}$. Finally, at rank 0, the partition is:

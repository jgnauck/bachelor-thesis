13,"Two directed graphs,labeled (A) on the left and (B) on the right. Each graph consists of five nodes numbered 1 to 5 and blue arrows, labeled with weights, connect the nodes. In both graphs, node 1 points to node 2 with weight -1 and node 2 points back to node 1 with weight 1. Node 3 has outgoing edges to node 2 (0.2) and node 5 (1). Node 4 points to node 1 with weight 0.2 and to node 3 with weight -0.5. Node 5 connects to node 4 with weight 1. All nodes feature red curved lines that loop from and to the same node without arrows. The difference between the two graphs is that graph (A) includes additional blue self-loops. Node 1 has a self-loop labeled -1, node 4 has a self-loop labeled -1 and node 5 has a self-loop labeled -1.","\documentclass[tikz,border=10pt]{standalone}

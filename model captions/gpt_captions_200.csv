The horizontal axis is labeled ""T f'r(B)"" on the right, with ""0"" at the center extending leftward toward ""R."" 

The quadrants are filled with numbers and annotations as follows: 

- In the top right quadrant, there are two entries: ""(1b)"" in the upper part and ""(2b)"" slightly below it.
- In the bottom right quadrant, there are two entries: ""(2)"" at the upper position and ""(3)"" below it. 
- In the bottom left quadrant, there's one entry: ""(1)"" at the upper position.
- In the top left quadrant, there's one entry: ""(4)"" at the lower position.

There are dotted lines extending horizontally at the level of ""0"" on the vertical axis and vertically at the level of ""0"" on the horizontal axis. The overall layout resembles a Cartesian plane divided into four quadrants with labels in each quadrant."
img_0185.png,"The image depicts a line graph where the horizontal axis is labeled ""Time (h)"" and spans from 0 to 24 hours, with tick marks at intervals of 5 hours. The vertical axis is labeled ""Cost ($/kW)"" and ranges from 0.1 to 0.14, with tick marks at increments of 0.01. The graph contains a series of data points connected by a blue line, with circular markers at each data point. The cost fluctuates over time, starting around 0.1, rising to approximately 0.13 between 5 and 10 hours, then dipping back to about 0.1 and slightly rising again around 15 hours before stabilizing around 0.11 towards the end of the time range. The background grid is light and helps in reading the values."
img_0186.png,"The image consists of several labeled nodes and directed edges, arranged in a way that resembles a graph. There are a total of 12 nodes, each represented by a number along with a subscript that denotes a specific category. The nodes are positioned in three distinct horizontal rows.

In the top row, there are four nodes: 61,4; 62,3; 62,4; and 61,3. These nodes are distributed toward the top corners of the image, with 61,4 located at the top left, and 62,4 located at the top right.

The middle row contains four nodes: 41,3; 42,3; 31,3; and 31,4. Here, 41,3 and 31,4 are positioned closely together in the middle, with an edge connecting them. 42,3 is to the right of these two nodes.

The bottom row contains the remaining four nodes: 11,4; 12,3; 12,4; and 21,3. These nodes are positioned toward the bottom and have edges directing to other nodes above them.

There are multiple directed edges between nodes, some of which form closed loops. The arrows indicate the direction of each edge. The overall layout of nodes and arrows shows a complex interconnection among them, with some nodes connecting seamlessly and others positioned further apart.

The background is plain with no additional markings, allowing the network of nodes and directed edges"
img_0187.png,"The image depicts a directed graph with nodes and arrows indicating relationships. There are five circular nodes labeled as follows: T, U1, A, C, and Z. Additionally, there is a node labeled U2, which is situated above both nodes C and A. The nodes are connected by directed arrows that represent the directed relationships between them.

The connections are as follows: 

- An arrow points from T to A.
- An arrow points from U1 to A. 
- An arrow also points from A to C. 
- Another arrow points from C to U2.
- A directed arrow goes from U2 back to C. 
- There is an arrow from A to Z.
- An arrow leads from Z to U1.

The layout positions node A at the center, with U1 directly below it, T to the left of A, C above A, U2 above C, and Z to the right of A. The overall arrangement creates a somewhat symmetrical structure around the central node A."
img_0188.png,"The image consists of three horizontal arrows arranged to form a branching diagram. At the top left, there is a label ""c_ℓ"" followed by an arrow pointing to the left towards ""C̄_ℓ"". The next arrow branches down from ""C̄_ℓ"" to the left pointing towards ""C̄_ℓ^+"", which is positioned below it. On the right side, parallel to the first branch, the arrow originates from ""C̄_ℓ"" pointing toward ""C̄_ℓ^-"", which is located slightly above the horizontal level of ""C̄_ℓ^+"". All elements are drawn using a simple font style without elaborate decorations, ensuring clarity in the representation. The overall structure resembles a tree with a main trunk leading to two branches."
img_0189.png,"The image depicts a mathematical graph consisting of two horizontal rows of points. The top row contains nine points labeled from 0 to 8, equally spaced from left to right. Below these points, there is a second row containing five red circles positioned directly beneath specific points in the top row; these red circles are situated beneath the points labeled 1, 3, 5, and 7.

Connecting the two rows, there are three types of edges:
1. **Horizontal edges**: Black lines connect adjacent points in the top row (e.g., between points 0 and 1, 1 and 2, etc., continuing to 7 and 8).
2. **Vertical edges**: Red lines connect the red circles in the bottom row to their corresponding points directly above them in the top row.
3. **Diagonal edges**: Blue lines connect the red circles to non-adjacent points in the top row. For each red circle, there are diagonal connections to multiple points above from the leftmost point (0) to the rightmost point (8).

The entire graph has a clean and structured layout, with consistent spacing and clearly defined connections among the points, circles, and lines."
img_0190.png,"The image is a graph depicting a quadratic function in a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is labeled ""S"" and ranges from -1 to 1, with tick marks at -1, 0, and 1. The vertical axis is labeled with an upward arrow, representing the output values of the function. 

The graph features a downward-facing parabolic curve that opens upwards, with its vertex at the origin (0,0). The parabolic curve extends smoothly from the left side, gradually rising as it approaches the vertex, then steeply descends as it moves to the right. The area beneath the curve and above the horizontal axis between S = -1 and S = 1 is shaded in diagonal stripes. The shading indicates the region under the curve from S = -1 to S = 1, highlighting the area of interest in this portion of the graph. The overall style is clean, with no additional grid lines or markings, giving it a minimalist appearance."
img_0191.png,"The image is a bar graph comparing two datasets, labeled ""img1"" and ""img2,"" categorized by clusters and ranks. On the x-axis, there are two bars: one labeled ""img1"" and the other ""img2."" The y-axis indicates ranks, ranging from approximately 900 to 1600. 

The bars for ""img1"" are all colored solid blue, indicating they fall within the ""0%-10%"" category. The bars for ""img2"" feature a combination of colors. The first bars on the left are also blue, representing the ""0%-10%"" category. Following these, there are several bars in green for the ""20%-30%"" category, then a few in yellow for ""30%-40%,"" and finally, one bar in red for the ""40%-50%"" range.

To the right of the graph, there is a legend that corresponds to the colors of the bars: blue for ""0%-10%,"" green for ""20%-30%,"" yellow for ""30%-40%,"" and red for ""40%-50%."" The title ""Clusters"" is placed above the bar graph. The overall appearance is clean, with well-defined axes, labels, and a consistent color scheme."

The left branch connects to a node labeled \( x_{1,1} \), also in black. This node has two children: the left child is labeled \( x_{2,1} \) in black, which further has two children labeled \( x_{3,1} \) and \( x_{3,2} \) in red. The right child of \( x_{1,1} \) is labeled \( x_{2,2 \) in green.

This node has two children: the left child is \( x_{2,3} \) in black, which further has two children labeled \( x_{3,5} \) and \( x_{3,6} \) in red. The right child of \( x_{1,2} \) is labeled \( x_{2,4} \) in red. 

The overall structure shows a mix of black and red nodes, with the node \( x_{2,2} \) standing out as green."
img_0193.png,"The image depicts a graph showing two distinct states of physical systems represented with pressure (P) as the vertical axis and a variable (not labeled, but likely related to volume or another thermodynamic property) as the horizontal axis. On the left side, the curves are labeled W2 and R2, represented by a blue curve and a black curve respectively. The blue curve (W2) appears to rise and then fall, while the black curve (R2) also fluctuates but remains lower than W2. 

On the right side, there are again two curves labeled W1 and R1. The curve W1 is shown in red and resembles W2 in shape but is higher overall on the graph. The black curve R1 is similar in style to R2, floating below W1. The vertical line between the two sides denotes a dividing point, and it seems to indicate some transition between the two systems in the graph. The overall layout features smooth, continuous curves with the lines intersecting at certain points, contributing to a clear visual contrast between the two sets of curves."
img_0194.png,"The image depicts a graph consisting of seven vertices labeled from v1 to v7. The vertices are arranged in a layout with specific connections. 

Vertices v1 and v2 are positioned at the lower left, both connected to vertex v3, which is in the center of the lower row. Vertex v3 connects horizontally to vertex v4, located slightly above it. Above v4, there are two vertices: v5, which is directly above v4, and v6, which is positioned to the upper right. Vertex v5 is horizontally aligned with v4 and connected to vertex v6. In the upper left, vertex v7 is positioned vertically higher and connects to v5. 

Connections between vertices are represented by lines: v1 and v2 connect to v3, v3 connects to v4, v4 connects to v5, v5 connects to v6, and v6 connects back to v7, creating a somewhat symmetrical structure with a horizontal arrangement of vertices along the center."

At the start, the expression ""1111|12"" is at the top and is labeled with ""rank 5"" below it. The next expression, ""111|2 1"" appears to its right, followed by an arrow pointing to it. Below this expression, ""rank 4"" is indicated. 

Continuing to the right, the next expression is ""12|2 1"" and is connected to the previous expression by another arrow. Below it, ""rank 3"" is labeled. Then, the expression ""12|2 1"" appears again, followed by the expression ""1|2 2 1"" which is to its right. This transition also has an arrow pointing to it, with ""rank 2"" indicated below.

To the right of this, ""1|2 2 1"" is followed by another arrow leading to a final expression ""1|2 1"" with ""rank 1"" below it.

img_0198.png,"The image consists of several overlapping curves in blue, set against a white background. The main features include a horizontal, wavy line that runs from left to right toward the bottom of the image. Above it, there is a pair of symmetric curves that rise and fall, intersecting with the wavy line at various points. The curves create an ""S"" shape in the middle, where they cross each other, and extend upwards to form a tall loop that tapers off towards the top right corner. The lines are thick and bold, with an additional lighter gray outline that complements the blue curves, enhancing the overall shape and depth of the design. The overall effect is an abstract representation, focusing on smooth, flowing forms rather than sharp angles or distinct shapes."

Each section has a light gray background with the word ""Image"" prominently displayed in the center in a large, bold font. The sections are labeled from top to bottom with lowercase letters in parentheses: (a), (b), (c), and (d). Each label is positioned in the top left corner of its respective section, and the overall design includes faint diagonal lines across the gray areas, contributing a subtle grid-like effect. The entire layout is framed by a thin black border."

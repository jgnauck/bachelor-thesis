img_0011,"tikz tree use pic as tree node
 
 This question does not aim to explore something meaningful, but just for some interest.
 Is there a way to use a pic as a ""tree node"" directly? It means that I can reference the named node or coordinate in pic after the tree has been draw.
 Consider following pic just for example:
 \documentclass[tikz, border=1cm]{standalone}
 \makeatletter
 \tikzset{
 test n/.store in=\test@n,
 test n=3,
 test/.pic={
 \foreach \x [evaluate=\x as \ang using (\x-1)*360/\test@n] in {1, ..., \test@n} {
 \draw (0, 0) -- (\ang:5mm) coordinate (-\x);
 }
 }
 }
 \makeatother
 
 \begin{document}
 \begin{tikzpicture}
 \pic (a) [test n=6] {test};
 \draw[red] (a-1) -- (a-2);
 \end{tikzpicture}
 \end{document}
 
 
 I'd like to use this pic in several nodes of the tree and reference the coordinates such as (a-1) after, is there a possible way to make it?","A tree diagram with a top node labeled ""root"". The root splits into two branches and the right branch further splits into two. Each node contains a symmetric star structure of three straight lines with a red line connecting the ends of two lines. The exception is the bottom-right node, which has four straight lines and no red connecting line."
img_0012,"Mixed graph (A) representing a model with $d = 5$ variables and with a diagonal $C$-matrix. The edge labels of the directed (blue) edges are the values of the non-zero entries in the $M$-matrix, while all the blunt (red) edges correspond to the diagonal entries of $C$ all being $1$. The mixed graph (B) is the same as (A) but with all directed self-loops removed. We call (B) the base graph of (A).","Two directed graphs,labeled (A) on the left and (B) on the right. Each graph consists of five nodes numbered 1 to 5 and blue arrows, labeled with weights, connect the nodes. In both graphs, node 1 points to node 2 with weight -1 and node 2 points back to node 1 with weight 1. Node 3 has outgoing edges to node 2 (0.2) and node 5 (1). Node 4 points to node 1 with weight 0.2 and to node 3 with weight -0.5. Node 5 connects to node 4 with weight 1. All nodes feature red curved lines that loop from and to the same node without arrows. The difference between the two graphs is that graph (A) includes additional blue self-loops. Node 1 has a self-loop labeled -1, node 4 has a self-loop labeled -1 and node 5 has a self-loop labeled -1."

At the midpoint the step ""anticipatory utility realized"" is marked and a vertical dashed line marks the division between Date 1 (left) and Date 2 (right). The timeline continues with ""the patient chooses e"" and finally ""the outcome reveals"". Arrows below the timeline indicate the span of Date 1 and Date 2."
img_0014,Workflow to obtain a Feasible Planning Region,"The figure shows a workflow that begins with ""Input data"" and ""Initialization"", followed by a loop involving ""Grid variation"", ""Generation of a Feasible Operation Region"" and ""Generation of a Feasible Planning Region"" within a gray block labeled ""Computation"". After each iteration, the system checks if ""grid refinement"" is needed. If true, the process loops back, if false the final output is produced."
img_0015,Effect of network coding on large network sizes (A:analytical and H:Heuristic),"The figure shows a graph illustrating the relationship between network size (x axis, ranging from 0 to 140 nodes) and power savings (y axis, measured in percentage from 0-50). Above the x-axis is a legend placed with the symbols line (red), ring (black) and star (blue) under two scenarios labeled (A) and (H). Across both scenarios, the line achieves the highest power saving, followed closely by the ring, while the star consistently shows the least power savings. The shape of the curves resembles logarithmic functions."

 I would like to draw three pictures in TikZ but I don't know how to do it.","Two geometric figures, an octagon on the left and a square on the right. Each vertex is marked with a black dot, connecting the vertex from each figure with black undirected lines. At the midpoint of each edge, a red dot is placed.

img_0028,"Externally set ymin, ymax, xmin and xmax with pgfplotset
 
 According to percusses answer in Argument to \input or \include statement? both height and width in the axis environment in PGFplots may be set externally (outside the axis environment) with a nested \pgfplotsset statement:
 \pgfplotsset{execute at begin axis={\pgfplotsset{width=5cm}}} 
 
 However, if I try to apply the same concept to xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax according to the answer suggested by Piotr, pgfplotsset doesn't seem to override the settings given within the axis environment.
 Consider the following MWE:
 \documentclass{article}
 \usepackage{pgfplots}
 \pgfplotsset{compat=newest}
 \begin{document}
 { % begin outer pgfplotsset scope
 \pgfplotsset{ymax=5, ymin=1, execute at begin axis={\pgfplotsset{width=5cm}}}

 \begin{axis}[width=10cm, ymin=0]
 \addplot {x^2};

 which produces the following graph, where ymin clearly is 0, though I just set it ymin=1 in pgfplotsset.
 
 
 What I want to achieve
 Set xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax from outside the axis environment (in a similar way as I do with width applying execute at begin axis in pgsplotsset), even though they also will be specified in \begin{axis}[]. The external call to xmin etc. should override the values set in \begin{axis}[].","A plot of a V-shaped curve that is symmetric about the vertical axis.

 One procedure which does that simply flares path coordinates by adding deviations in multiples. These increase or decrease depending where on the line they are. Also this is done recursively over a set of deviations. We plot the many overlapping curves. The result is shown above.
 
 QUESTION: The problem is \def accepts <10 inputs. So how do I extend \def for arbitrary even number of arguments >10 that is a multiple of another number? We require this to control lines in such drawings. Each x and y argument is separately transformed by the for each loop as a function of the hand fixed numerical parameters ps.
 
 Please suggest how to input the coordinates in a tuple form, not in a form {x1}{y1}{p1}{x2}{y2}{p2}... That becomes confusing when all the inputs are given numbers and the curve is edited, and it becomes ambiguous if errors are input made. Treat |x,y,p| as one argument, extract the x and y and p.

 Tikz is more convenient for combining this with equation work and outputs this faster. It also allows treating parts of other outputs as graphic nodes and has powerful libraries. Metapost works best with equation defined pens and curves, or if the ends of the curves need to be sharp and rotated. However, the bezier parameters for each thick pen turn requires tweaking that covaries with each curve. My implementation here requires tweaking at most one parameter.
 The n-argument macro from the answer to this question is great. I tried to generalize the answer in this usage; but the commented out version gives undefined control sequence error.

 The doubledash hatchmarks seem necessary to get the error, if both of them are removed, then the document compiles:
 
 I guess the 16384 limit has been reached by some internal calculation were the doubledash is involved, but how exactly, I have no idea...
 It's worth noticing that other pictures did compile while preserving the doubledash but that some of them required to round the coordinates to the tenth, what, in the case of an isosceles triangle, is not really satisfying since the triangle then looks slightly slanted. In the example above, this solution actually ""works"" too, but required to round the coordinates of M to the unit, what is even worse (after that, the triangle doesn't look isosceles at all!).
 Some more context
 I am currently working on a software library (written in python) that creates such TikZ code in an automated way and I need to be able to anticipate when this error will be triggered, in order to produce a compilable picture. It's not possible to try to compile the produced code and then try again and again with slightly different values until it's ""ok"" (and the picture maybe quite different than expected).
 Question
 How to ensure that the document will compile before trying to compile?
 EDIT: from Zarcos' answer, it seems that increasing the angle's radius solves the problem. But how is it possible to anticipate which minimal value will be required for the picture to compile well? (The 1st example requires 0.35 cm, and the 2d example, below, requires 0.85 cm).

img_0079,"Nodes and matrix of nodes
 
 I know thanks to @TorbjørnT. that messing with nodes and matrix of nodes is not recommended as you would no more be able to use (m-1-1) for a coordinate of a cell of a matrix m. (cf. Compilation problem with tikz diagram)
 Now my question is: I define a node shape like that
 \newcommand{\bSum}[4]{ 
 \node [draw=\linecolor, circle,minimum size=1.5em, \linetype, fill=\backgroundcolor, drop shadow={opacity=\dark}] (sum) at (0,0) {}; 
 \node [draw, cross out, minimum size=1.0em, thin, draw=gray!50] {}; 
 \node [above of= sum, node distance = 0.45em] () { \color{\colortext}\tiny{$#1$}}; 
 \node [left of= sum, node distance = 0.45em] () { \color{\colortext}\tiny{$#2$}}; 
 \node [below of= sum, node distance = 0.45em] () { \color{\colortext}\tiny{$#3$}}; 
 \node [right of= sum, node distance = 0.45em] () { \color{\colortext}\tiny{$#4$}}; 
 }
 
 There is no way for me to use only \draw command to design such a shape because of its arguments.
 If I try to use this (now compilable) code, if I uncomment the \draw ... it won't work:

img_0172,"tikz-decoration: How do I use ""is input segment is closepath=< options>""?
 
 In the answer to this question TikZ decorations: How to draw a closed path little by little? @marmot uses this option of the decoration automaton in a way that I don't understand very well but that works perfectly thanks to pgf keys. 
 \pgfkeys{pgf/.cd,
 close/.code={\pgfpathclose}}
 
 \pgfdeclaremetadecoration{draw part of a path}{initial}{
 \state{initial}[width={\pgfmetadecoratedpathlength*\pgfdecorationsegmentlength},next state=final]{
 \decoration{lineto}
 }
 \state{final}{\ifdim\pgfdecorationsegmentlength>0.999pt
 \pgfkeys{/pgf/decoration automaton/if input segment is closepath=/pgf/close}
 \fi 
 }
 }
 %
 \tikzset{start segment/.style={decoration={draw part of a path,raise=2mm,segment length=#1},decorate}} 
 
 Indeed, according to the manual it is an option of the decoration automaton and as such it should be used as follows: \state{final}[if input segment is closepath=\closepath]{} but then the path is no longer closed. 
 The manual says: 
 
 /pgf/decoration automaton/if input segment is closepath= < options > (no default)
 This key checks whether the current input segment is a
 closepath operation. If so, the <options> get executed; otherwise
 nothing happens. You can use this option to handle a closepath in some
 special way, for instance, switching to a new state in which
 \pgfpathclose is executed.
 
 First question:
 Why does writing state{final}[if input segment is closepath=\pgfpathclose]{} not work?
 Question 2:
 
 How to use this option to change the state of the decoration automaton as indicated by the manual?
 How do I use “is input segment is closepath=< options>”?

 Thank you","The figure is a grouped bar chart with four labeled groups along the horizontal axis: ""alg1"", ""alg2"", ""alg3"", and ""alg4"". Each group contains two vertical bars of different heights and colors. The vertical axis is labeled ""Measure (\%)"" and marked from 0 to 60 in increments of 10. For alg1, the left bar is red and reaches slightly above 40, while the shorter right bar is also red and reaches around 25. For alg2, the left bar is yellow and reaches slightly above 25; the right yellow bar is shorter and reaches around 15. For alg3, the left green bar reaches just under 40, and the right green bar reaches around 27. The left bar for alg4 is blue and reaches slightly below 40.

img_0198,"Straightforward gaps in crossing lines with gapless background highlights?
 
 I'm drawing some crossing lines, some of which are emphasized by a thick, gray line in the background. Now, I'd like to have gaps where the lines cross, and I am able to achieve this by using inverted clipping, but the problem is that the resulting PDF seems to be a bit heavy to render. I'll be using the PDFs in Keynote (OS X), and in the more recent versions, it's really slow to render more complex PDFs. (Tips for solving that are also appreciated, but probably not on topic here. I've had some success with rendering to images or movies, but that's less than satisfactory…)
 First, a version using just a white line for the gap—a common tecnique that obviously doesn't work:
 \begin{tikzpicture}[draw=solarized-blue]
 \pts
 \draw[line width=3pt,black!15] (a) -- (b);
 \draw[thick] (a) -- (b);
 \draw[ultra thick, white] (x) -- (y);
 \draw[thick] (x) -- (y);
 \end{tikzpicture}
 
 
 This is my current solution, which leads to PDFs that some viewers (or at least Keynote, and perhaps other Quartz apps) have some trouble rendering when i have more than a handful of lines:
 \begin{tikzpicture}[draw=solarized-blue]
 \pts
 \draw[line width=3pt,black!15] (a) -- (b);
 \begin{scope}[even odd rule]
 \draw[thick] (x) -- (y);
 \clip[overlay]
 (-1cm,-1cm) rectangle (1cm,1cm)
 ($(x)!0.8pt!90:(y)$) -- ($(y)!0.8pt!-90:(x)$) --
 ($(y)!0.8pt!90:(x)$) -- ($(x)!0.8pt!-90:(y)$) --
 cycle;
 \draw[thick] (a) -- (b); 
 \end{scope}
 \end{tikzpicture}
 
 
 I've tried one alternate solution, using transparency, and putting the “background” line on top – but then I have to adjust the color of the main line itself. Here I've just added some white, but I guess I'd really have to reduce the amount of black. Also, it messes with the colors of the crossing lines, so this doesn't really work:
 \begin{tikzpicture}[draw=solarized-blue]
 \pts
 \draw[thick,draw=solarized-blue!85!white] (a) -- (b);
 \draw[ultra thick, white] (x) -- (y);
 \draw[thick] (x) -- (y);
 \draw[line width=3pt,black,opacity=.15] (a) -- (b);
 \end{tikzpicture}
 \end{document}
 
 
 Are there any clean ways of doing this that won't lead to overly complex clipping paths or the like?

The frequency shift of the downstream wave packet is (a) $\Omega$, (b) $-4\Omega$, (c) $16\Omega$, and (b) $-32\Omega$, where $\Omega = 2 \pi \times 1.15$~THz.","Four vertically stacked squares, each with a gray background and the word ""Image"" written in bold at the center. Each square is divided by a vertical line, a horizontal line and two diagonal lines, creating eight triangular sections. The squares are labeled sequentially from top to bottom as ""(a)"", ""(b)"", ""(c)"" and ""(d)"". The squares appear layered closely on top of each other, forming a vertical column."
